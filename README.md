# Introduction
Big Data Programming Languages – BMSTU

This repository serves as a platform for me to share my solutions to the course assignments in Kotlin. As we explore the use of programming languages such as Kotlin in managing and processing large datasets, I am excited to delve deeper into the capabilities of Kotlin and its potential applications in big data.

Happy coding 🕊️
